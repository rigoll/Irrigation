Installation and Setup Instructions:
Since this is just I few Lines of C++ Code the install is verry straightforward, just download the code and put it in your Arduino.


Reflection.
This idea was born because of two reasons. First my plants tend to live for about 1-2 months and second a wanted to learn more about practical programming, was getting tired of the compiler writing "Hello world". This was my first build with arduino and C++. When I started this project I had a little bit different vision of what this was going to be. My plan was to write this on Rpi whith Java and connect a screen to it for better overview, turned out I didnt want or need the monitor and therefore the Rpi became redundant and arduiono was better suited. It took far longer to complete this then I planned. Mostly because ordering stuff from China takes time especially due to Covid-19. One of the hardest part with this project was working on the electronics but I did get a ton of experience.
This project is complete altough there is things to add, besides maintainence is still a thing when you order cheap components from China.
